Using Foursquare Location Data** : As a part of the assignment, for this business problem I will use the Foursquare API to retrieve information about the popular spots around these 5 Major Boroughs of New York. The popular spots returned depends on the highest foot traffic and thus it depends on the time when the call is made. So, we may get different popular venues depending upon different time of the day. \n",
